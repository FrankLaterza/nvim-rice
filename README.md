# Nvim Configs
i had to build nvim from the rasberrypi so in just putting the binaries here so i can copy them to other devices 

# Config 
this repo has binaries for nvim and lazygit that should be moved into ``usr/bin/`` for usage. 


there are also plugins for the lazygit and other things integration. after nvim is installed these folders should be copied into the directory ``config/nvim/lua/``

custom nvim configs can be copied over too under ``~/.config/nvim/init.lua``

# Install
there is also an install script
```
sudo ./install.sh
```
